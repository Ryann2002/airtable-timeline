# .gitignore

# This file tells Git which files and folders it should not track.
# It's useful for keeping compiled code, dependencies, and secret files
# out of your version history.

### Dependencies ###
# The node_modules folder contains all the project's dependencies.
# It can be very large and should always be ignored.
# You can reinstall all dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
/node_modules

### Build output ###
# The build folder contains the final, compiled version of your app.
# This is generated when you run `npm run build`.
# You should not track this folder because it's generated from your source code.
/build
/dist
/.parcel-cache

### Development files ###
# The .env.local file is used to store local environment variables,
# like API keys or database secrets. These should never be committed to Git.
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

### Log files ###
# Log files created by npm or yarn.
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

### Editor directories and files ###
# These are configuration files created by popular code editors.
# It's good practice to ignore them to avoid conflicts between developers.
